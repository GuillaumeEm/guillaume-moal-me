### Site config

You can change global site configuration on '/src/config.ts' file:

- **SITE_TITLE**: Default pages title.
- **SITE_DESCRIPTION**: Default pages title.
- **GENERATE_SLUG_FROM_TITLE**: By default Astrofy will generate the blog slug pages base on the article name. Set this var to false if you want to use the Astro file base (Compatible with Astrofy older versions).
- **TRANSITION_API**: Enable and disable transition API

### Components usage

#### Layout Components

The `BaseHead`, `Footer`, `Header`, and `SideBar` components are already included in the layout system. To change the website content you can edit the content of these components.

##### SideBar

In the Sidebar you can change your profilePicture, links to all your website pages, and your social icons.

You can change your avatar shape using [mask classes](https://daisyui.com/components/mask/).

The used social-icons are SVG form [BoxIcons](https://boxicons.com/) pack. You can replace the icons in the `SideBarFooter` component

To add a new page in the sidebar go to the `SideBarMenu` component.

```
<li><a class="py-3 text-base" id="home" href="/">Home</a></li>

```

**Note**: In order to change the sidebar menu's active item, you need to setup the prop `sideBarActiveItemID` in the `BaseLayout` component of your new page and add that id to the link in the `SideBarMenu`

#### TimeLine

The timeline components are used to confirm the CV.

```html
<div class="time-line-container">
  <TimeLineElement title="Element Title" subtitle="Subtitle">
    Content that can contain
    <div>divs</div>
    and <span>anything else you want</span>.
  </TimeLineElement>
  ...
</div>
```

#### Card & HorizontalCard

The cards are primarly used for the Project and the Blog components. They include a picture, a title, and a description.

```html
<HorizontalCard title="Card Title" img="imge_url" desc="Description" url="Link
URL" target="Optional link target (_blank default)" badge="Optional badge"
tags={['Array','of','tags']} />
```


#### Adding a Custom Component

To add a custom component, you can create a .astro file in the components folder under the source folder.

Components must follow this template. The ```---``` represents the code fence and uses Javascript and can be used for imports.

The HTML component is the actual style of your new component.

```html
---
// Component Script (JavaScript)
---
<!-- Component Template (HTML + JS Expressions) -->
```

For more details, see the [astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) documentation here.

### Layouts

Include `BaseLayout` in each page you add and `PostLayout` to your post pages.

The BaseLayout defines a general template for each new webpage you want to add. It imports constants SITE_TITLE and SITE_DESCRIPTION which can be modified in the ```../config``` folder. Data placed there can be imported anywhere using import.

### Content

You can add a [content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) in `/content/' folder, you will need add it at config.ts.

#### config.ts

Where you need to define your content collections, we define our content schemas too.
